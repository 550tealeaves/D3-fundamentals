# Legendary Pokemon stats

## Dataset
I wanted to create a visualization about Legendary Pokemon. So I found a dataset on kaggle that lists all Pokemon in the first 8 generations (there are currently nine), including the variants. I limited the data to the first 3 generations, of which I am the most familiar.

## Visualization
The first viz is a static pie chart depicting the amount of legendary pokemon (31) in the first 3 generations versus "regular". 

The second viz is an interactive lollipop chart showcasing the seven stats of said legendary Pokemon. 
The viewer gets to decide which one is actually best.
