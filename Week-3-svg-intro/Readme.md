# Homework 2
## Aim
Using a sample data set, I will demonstrate knowledge of SVGs by creating a basic scatter plot with the "circle" SVG.

**Circles have 3 attributes or arguments**
1.  cx (x-coordinate of center of circle)
2.  cy (y-coordinate of center of circle)
3.  r (radius)

Then we will use code to create text labels that display the circle coordinates along with some other styling, like position, font-style, font-size, and color. 

After much frustration, I was able to generate the scatter plot, however, the text labels are difficult to re-position. The text moves but it does not align with the corresponding data points.
